### USAGE
As of right now, it is a private bot. When I have it running, anyone within my Discord server can make use of the commands with the prefix and then a valid command. I plan to make it public once I add more functionality and security.

- Examples:
    - !help : The bot will send you a direct message with a list of the current commands which you can then request further information on the commands individually.

    - !play [youtube link] : The bot enters the discord channel you are in and begins playing the audio from the link.
    
	

    - !creation : Tells the date the discord server was created in the text channel the command was used.
    
    - !ping : The bot replies "Pong!" in the text channel the command was used.
    - !doggo : The bot replies with a random image of a dog

    - Many more to come, whatever I think would be beneficiary to have on my Discord server!

### ABOUT
This program is useful for sharing music and other audio aspects of youtube with friends as you can all be within the same Discord voice channel and anyone can hear the audio the bot is playing. The creation and doggo commands are also extremely useful for their functionality, as there isn't that kind of functionality in the base Discord app. I plan to add many more commands like this that add new functionality to my Discord server. This bot can also be fun to play around with as I am going to make it interact with users through commands among other things.
